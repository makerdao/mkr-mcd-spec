STEPS ( DEPLOY-PRELUDE )
STEPS ( ATTACK-PRELUDE )

// Attack Sequence
// ---------------

// Set sump (determines DAI bid size for flop auctions)
transact ADMIN Vow . file sump 50

// Set dump (determines initial MKR lot size for flop auctions)
transact ADMIN Vow . file dump 30

// Set tau (flop auction lifetime in seconds)
transact ADMIN Flop . file tau 3600

// Use suck to give Bobby some DAI, which conveniently also creates enough free, unbacked debt for 2 flop auctions
transact ADMIN Vat . suck Vow "Bobby" 100

// Start a flop auction
transact "Bobby" Vow . flop

// Bobby bids (1 = auction id, 25 = MKR lot, 50 = DAI bid)
transact "Bobby" Flop . dent 1 25 50

// Bobby calls heal (should actually call kiss to avoid the bug)
transact "Bobby" Vow . heal 50

// Now we can't flop because debt is stuck as Ash
transact "Bobby" Vow . flop
